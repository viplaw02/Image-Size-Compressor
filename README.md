<h1>Image Upload and Resize Project</h1>

This Node.js application allows users to upload image files, resize them to a specified size, and save them to a server directory. The resizing is performed using the `sharp` library, and the system handles various image formats and ensures that files are not enlarged beyond their original dimensions.

 Features

- File Upload: Upload image files through an API endpoint.
- File Resize: Resize images to fit within a target size while preserving the aspect ratio.
- Directory Management: Automatically creates an upload directory if it doesnâ€™t exist.
- Error Handling: Includes error handling for invalid input and file processing issues.
- Supported Formats: Handles common image formats like JPEG, PNG, WebP, TIFF, and GIF.

 Installation

1. Clone the Repository

   bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install Dependencies

   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Run:

   bash
   npm install
   

3. Create `.env` File

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory if needed for configuration. For this project, no environment variables are required by default.

Usage

1. Start the Server

   To start the server, run:

  bash
  npm start
  

2. Upload and Resize Files

   Use an API client like Postman to test the file upload and resize functionality.

   Endpoint: `POST /upload`

   Request Body:
   - `file` (form-data): The image file to upload.
   - `targetSizeKB` (form-data): The maximum target size of the resized image in kilobytes.

   Response:
   - Success: Returns a JSON object with success status and file details.
   - Error: Returns error messages for invalid input or processing issues.
 Example

Uploading a File

In Postman or any HTTP client:

- Method: `POST`
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/upload`
- Body: Form-data
 Key: `file`, Type: `File`, Value: [Select image file]
Key: `targetSizeKB`, Type: `Text`, Value: `200` (for example)

Response

On success:

json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "File resized and saved successfully",
  "data": {
    "name": "resized-image.jpg",
    "path": "/uploads/resized-image.jpg",
    "size": 204800  // Size in bytes
  }
}


On error:`json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid target size provided. Please provide a positive integer value."
}
```
 Directory Structure

- `index.js`: Main server file
- `model/`: Contains Mongoose models
  - `file.js`: Mongoose schema for file metadata
- `uploads/`: Directory where uploaded and resized files are saved
